imgpool is a fast and secure temporary storage which could resize and convert remote images.

imgpool does one thing â€” resizing remote images â€” and stored it in temporary storage. It works great when you need to resize multiple images on the fly to make them match your application design without preparing a ton of cached resized images or re-doing it every time the design changes.

imgpool is a Go application, ready to be installed and used in any Unix environment â€” also ready to be containerized using Docker.
